# HillSafe: Enhancing Safety and Efficiency in Hilly Terrains

## Project Overview

HillSafe is an advanced safety and monitoring system designed to detect non-moving vehicles in hair-pin bends and challenging terrains at hill stations. The system leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance road safety, prevent accidents, and improve traffic management in hilly areas.

## Features

- **Non-Moving Vehicle Detection**: Identifies stationary vehicles in critical sections of the road, such as hair-pin bends.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Provides immediate notifications to drivers and authorities about potential hazards.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Collects and analyzes traffic data to optimize safety measures and traffic flow.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Can be integrated with existing traffic management systems for seamless operation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: 
  - Cameras (with night vision capability)
  - Sensors for vehicle detection
  - Processing unit (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or a similar device)
- **Software**:
  - Operating system (e.g., Linux)
  - Python 3.x
  - Required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Mount the cameras at strategic locations in the hair-pin bends.
   - Connect sensors to detect vehicle presence.
   - Set up the processing unit and connect it to the cameras and sensors.

2. **Software Installation**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HillSafe.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd HillSafe
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configure camera and sensor settings in the `config.yaml` file.
   - Adjust detection parameters according to your specific terrain and requirements.

4. **Run the System**:
   - Start the detection script:
     ```bash
     python detect_nonmoving_vehicles.py
     ```

## Usage

- The system will continuously monitor the hair-pin bend for non-moving vehicles.
- When a stationary vehicle is detected, the system will trigger an alert and log the event.
- Alerts can be configured to notify drivers through visual signals or through a connected app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Cameras not capturing images.
  - **Solution**: Check camera connections and ensure they are powered on. Verify camera settings in the configuration file.
  
- **Issue**: False positives in vehicle detection.
  - **Solution**: Adjust the detection sensitivity in the `config.yaml` file to better suit the environment.
